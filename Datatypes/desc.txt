#This file contains the description of basics in C programming "Datatypes"

Data Type are keywords which specify the size of variables and its characteristics.
By providing datatype to identifiers user create containers in memory to store data
and later operate on it. Based on datatype memory will be reserved by compiler.

Types of datatypes
1. Primitive (Basic(built-in) containers)
	a. char
	b. int
	c. float
	d. double
	e. void
2. Derived (Assemblage of built-in datatype)
	a. array
	b. function
	b. pointer
	c. reference
2. User-Defined (Customization of built-in datatypes)
	a. structure
	b. union
	c. enum
	d. typedef

Q. How to declare datatype?
Q. What is the use of datatype?
Q. How to input using that datatype?
Q. How to get size and address of that datatype?

All answers will be covered on individual datatype file on current directory.
Data types can be used as
  Variables - Name of the variable are called identifiers
  Function return type
  Array type
  Union Members
  Structure members
