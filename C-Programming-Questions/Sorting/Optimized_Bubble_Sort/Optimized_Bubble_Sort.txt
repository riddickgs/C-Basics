Optimized Bubble Sort:

WTD: Sort an array using an optimized version of bubble sort.

Bubble Sort: This is a simple sorting algorithm that works by swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. The optimization stops if no swaps are made during a pass.

(e.g.: I/P: [5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6]; O/P: [1, 2, 5, 5, 6, 9])
