Counting Sort for Negative Numbers:


WTD: Sort an array that includes negative numbers using counting sort.

Counting Sort: Works by counting the occurrences of each unique element and then positioning them in a sorted manner.

(e.g.: I/P: [4, 2, 2, 8, 3, 3, 1, -1, -2]; O/P: [-2, -1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 8])
