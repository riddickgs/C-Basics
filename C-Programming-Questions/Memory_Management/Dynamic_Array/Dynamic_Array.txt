Dynamic Array:

Implement a dynamic array with the ability to resize itself.

How to do?
- Start with an initial size.
- When adding an element, check if the array is full. If so, resize it.
- When removing an element, consider resizing down if the array is less than half full.

Hint: Use malloc and free (or your custom allocator) to manage the dynamic memory.
