Create a structure that can represent a color in both RGB and CMYK formats. Use a union to switch between the RGB representation and the CMYK representation.

WTD: Formulate a structure capable of representing color information. This structure should support dual representations: in RGB format and in CMYK format. Using a union, ensure seamless switching between these two representations.

(e.g: I/P: Color Type: RGB, RGB: [255, 0, 128]; O/P: RGB Color: [255, 0, 128])
