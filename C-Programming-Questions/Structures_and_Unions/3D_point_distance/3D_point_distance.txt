Define a structure to represent a 3D point in space. Write functions to calculate the distance between two points.

WTD: Design a structure to model a 3D point in space. Develop functions that calculate the Euclidean distance between any two given points using the standard distance formula.
Use Distance formula D= Sqrt( (x2-x1)^2  + (y2-y1)^2  + ( z2-z1)^2))

(e.g: I/P P1(1.0,2.0,3.0), P2(4.0,6.0,8.0); O/P is Distance= 7.071 )
