Define a structure for a complex number. Implement functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of two complex numbers.

WTD: Design a structure to represent a complex number. Develop a suite of functions that allow for mathematical operations on complex numbers, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

(e.g: I/P: Complex1: 4+5i, Complex2: 2+3i, SUB; O/P: Result: 2+2i )
