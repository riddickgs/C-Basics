Isolate the Rightmost Set Bit. Write a function to isolate the rightmost set bit of an integer.

WTD: Given an integer, isolate the rightmost bit set to 1 in its binary representation. Use bitwise operations to find this bit while setting all other bits to 0.

(e.g.: I/P:  0b10100000; O/P: 0b00100000)
