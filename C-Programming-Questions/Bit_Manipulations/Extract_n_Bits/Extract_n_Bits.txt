Extract  n  Bits. Design a function to extract  n  bits from a byte starting from a given position  p .

WTD: You have a byte, and you need to extract n bits starting from a given position p. Use bitwise operations to isolate these n bits and return them as an integer.

(e.g.: I/P:  Byte: 0b10101100, n=3, p=2; O/P: 0b101
