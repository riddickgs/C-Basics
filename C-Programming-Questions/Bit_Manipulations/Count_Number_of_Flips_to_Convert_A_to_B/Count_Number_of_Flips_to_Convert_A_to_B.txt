Count Number of Flips to Convert  A  to  B. Implement a function that counts the number of flips required to convert integer  A  to integer  B .

WTD: You are given two integers A and B. Determine the number of bits you need to flip to convert A into B using bitwise operations.

(e.g.: I/P:  A=29 (0b11101), B=15 (0b01111); O/P: 2)
