Check for Alternate Bits. Write a function to check if bits in a given number are in alternate pattern.

WTD: Given an integer, check if the bits in its binary representation alternate between 0 and 1. Use bitwise operations to traverse the bits and perform the check.

(e.g.: I/P:  0b10101010; O/P: True)
