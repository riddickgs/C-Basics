Mask Certain Bits. Implement a function that masks (sets to zero) all bits except for the first  n  bits of an integer.

WTD: Given an integer, mask (set to zero) all but the first n bits. Use bitwise operations to perform this masking and return the resulting integer.

(e.g.: I/P:  0b10101111, n=4; O/P: 0b00001111)
