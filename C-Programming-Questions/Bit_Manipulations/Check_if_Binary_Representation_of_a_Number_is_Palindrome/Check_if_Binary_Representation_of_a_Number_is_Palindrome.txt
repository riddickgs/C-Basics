Check if Binary Representation of a Number is Palindrome. Write a function to check if the binary representation of a number is a palindrome.

WTD: For a given integer, determine whether its binary representation reads the same forwards and backwards. Use bitwise operations to extract each bit for the check.

(e.g.: I/P:  9 (0b1001); O/P: True)
