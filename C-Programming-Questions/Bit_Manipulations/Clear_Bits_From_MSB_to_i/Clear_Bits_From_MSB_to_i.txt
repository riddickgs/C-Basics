Write a function that clears all the bits from the most significant bit through i (inclusive) in a given number.

WTD: You have an integer. Clear all the bits from the most significant bit to bit i (inclusive). Use bitwise operations to perform this action and return the modified integer.

(e.g. :I/P: 0b11111111, i=3; O/P: 0b00001111)
