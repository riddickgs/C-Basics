Write a function that toggles the 3rd and 5th bits of an 8-bit number.

WTD: You have an 8-bit number. Your task is to toggle the bits at positions 3 and 5 (counting from the least significant bit). Use bitwise operations to modify these specific bits while leaving the others unchanged.

(e.g.: I/P:  0b10100101; O/P: 0b10000101)
