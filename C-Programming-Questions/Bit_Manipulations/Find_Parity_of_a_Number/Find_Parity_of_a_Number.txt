Find Parity of a Number. Implement a function to check if the number of 1s in the binary representation of a given number is even or odd.

WTD: Given an integer, find the parity of its binary representation. Use bitwise operations to count the number of bits set to 1 and determine if it's odd or even.

(e.g.: I/P:  7 (0b0111); O/P: Odd)
