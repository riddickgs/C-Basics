In a sorted array, find two numbers that add up to a specific target sum "N".


WTD: Create a function that, in a sorted array, finds two numbers that add up to a specific target sum "N". Use a two-pointer technique or binary search for an efficient solution.


Algorithm: Use two-pointer technique or binary search.

(e.g.: I/P: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], N = 9; O/P: (4, 5))
