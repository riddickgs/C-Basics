Count the number of times a sorted array is rotated.


WTD: Write a function that counts the number of times a sorted array is rotated. Use binary search to identify the pivot element, which indicates the rotation count.


Algorithm: Use binary search to find the pivot element.

(e.g.: I/P: [15, 18, 2, 3, 6, 12]; O/P: 2)
