Find a fixed point (value equal to index) in a given array.


WTD: Write a function to find a fixed point (an element equal to its index) in a sorted array. Use binary search to efficiently find a fixed point.


Algorithm: Use binary search for a sorted array.

(e.g.: I/P: [-10, -5, 1, 3, 7, 9, 12, 17] ; O/P: 3)
