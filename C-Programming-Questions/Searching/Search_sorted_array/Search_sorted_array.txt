Search for an element in a sorted array.

WTD: Implement a function that performs binary search to find a target element in a sorted array. You'll need to start by comparing the target with the middle element and adjust your search range accordingly. Divide and conquer by halving the array.

Algorithm: Binary search divides the array into halves and compares the middle element to the target.

(e.g.: I/P: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 4 ; O/P: 3)
