Implement a custom memory allocator and deallocator. Track allocations and deallocations to detect memory leaks using pointers.

WTD:  Implement custom allocation and deallocation functions. Maintain a list of allocated blocks. On deallocation, remove from the list. At the end, non-deallocated blocks are leaks.

(e.g.: I/P: Allocate 5 blocks, deallocate 4 blocks ; O/P: 1 block not deallocated)
