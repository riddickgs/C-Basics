Create a function that segregates even and odd values of an integer array using pointers.

WTD: Use two pointers, one starting from the beginning and the other from the end. Traverse and swap even and odd numbers until the two pointers meet.

(e.g.: I/P: int arr[] = {12,34,9,8,45,90} ,O/P: {12,34,8,90,9,45} )
