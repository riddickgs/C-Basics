Design a function that determines if two pointers point to the same array.

WTD: Traverse from both pointers in both forward and backward directions until null or boundary is hit. If both pointers hit the same boundaries, they belong to the same array.

(e.g.: I/P: int arr[] = {1,2,3,4}, *ptr1 = &arr[1], *ptr2 = &arr[3]; O/P: True )
