Find the common ancestor of two nodes in a binary tree represented as a doubly linked list.

WTD: Traverse the binary tree represented as a doubly linked list and find the common ancestor of the given two nodes. Utilize parent pointers in the doubly linked list to backtrack.

(e.g.: I/P: Nodes 6 and 9 in Binary Tree 4->5->6->7->8->9; O/P: 7)
